We choose "does the stock market capitalization grow faster than the GDP" as our topic.
In general, we consider that the changes in stock market capitalization reflect GDP. Whether stocks go up or down affects people's consumption, which ultimately affects GDP. But this is just one example of how stocks affect GDP. We don't the exact correlation between them. Therefore, we think this topic will be menaingful. At the same time, relevant data will be easier to find.
