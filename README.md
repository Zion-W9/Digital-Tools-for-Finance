# Digital-Tools-for-Finance
## Intro
This is the repository for the homework and final project for the course "Digital Tools for Finance" offered at UZH in the autumn semester 2022 (see repo: https://github.com/ipozdeev/it-skills-for-research). 

The branch `homework` shows the homework for week1 to week6.

The branch `feature-1` is used for an exercise of git collaborating in week4.

The branch `main` is used for our final project, which is intended to practice all the tools we learned during the lecture. 


## Project Topic
Correlation between stock market and GDP:
empirical evidence from Switzerland

## Project description
In general, we consider that the changes in stock market capitalization reflect GDP. Whether stocks go up or down affects people's consumption, which ultimately affects GDP. But this is just one example of how stocks affect GDP. We don't the exact correlation between them. Therefore, we think this topic will be meaningful. At the same time, relevant data will be easier to find.
