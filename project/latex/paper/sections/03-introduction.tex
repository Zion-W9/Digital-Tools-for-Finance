\section{Introduction}

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is an intergovernmental international economic organization composed of 38 market-economy countries, aiming to jointly address the economic, social and governance challenges brought about by globalization.

GDP is an important indicator to measure the economic status and development level of a country or region, and it is closely related to economic policies and markets. Some past studies have explored the impact of the stock market on GDP. We hope to extend these studies and explore whether GDP will in turn affect the stock market. Most of the OECD countries are developed economies, which are ideal samples for studying the relationship between the stock market and GDP.

The industrial structure of GDP has changed significantly over the past few decades. In the same time span, the stock index has also undergone large changes. However, changes in stock indices are sometimes out of sync with changes in GDP. A more obvious example is the creation and bursting of stock market bubbles. Exploring the relationship between the stock market and GDP is a breakthrough in the study of such issues.
