\section{Conclusion}

Using share price data in the OECD group, this paper studies the long-horizon relationship between share price growth and GDP growth. Generally, the stock price increases when GDP grows in T+3 period and deceases when GDP declines in T+3 period. It may indicate the perfect capital market where the share price incorporates the future market information. However, the relationship and magnitude is not consistent across all sample countries. In Switzerland, there is significantly positive between stock price growth and GDP growth. 1\% increase of GDP in T+3 periods will cause 0.025\% rise of share price in T period.
